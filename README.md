# User-Detector
This is an example using opencv with python to recognise myself over my laptop camera and send my id to my 
FPGA (also i could use an microcontroller instead) this example is based on 
[Anirban Kar](http://thecodacus.com/author/admin/ example.This little program is intended to be my first artificial intelligence homework.
